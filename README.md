# Patient-Suite-Control-System
The IoT solution is called the Patient Suite Control System. It is an IoT application placed and applied in a patient's room to monitor the entire environmental condition, as well as the patient, and provide certain control abilities for the devices around the patient suite. The system allows the patient to control several components located inside a particular setup environment and allows sending notifications or inquiry requests to the caregiver or outsiders. Other users, such as nurses, family members, or anyone taking care of the patient, could use this system to monitor the patient's condition and respond to any emergencies or inquiries triggered by the patient. The system will use several sensors and actuators to demonstrate the concept of the usage and use cases of the application, for which more advanced and matured models of the hardware devices are needed if the application is considered to be implemented as a commercial application.
